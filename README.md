## üèÅ Getting Started

> üöß This section is focused on **Onboarding** and is currently a work in progress.  
> For now, use the links below to get started:

- üîê [Login](http://localhost:3000/login)
- üÜï [Onboarding (Sign Up)](http://localhost:3000/login)

More detailed onboarding guides, examples, and templates will be added soon. Stay tuned!

# Development Setup

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.14.2 or higher)  
- npm, yarn, or pnpm  
- GitHub account (for OAuth authentication)  

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Web.git
cd Dijkstra-Web
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# or using yarn
yarn install

# or using pnpm
pnpm install

# or using bun
bun install
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

---

<!-- ### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
touch .env.local
```

Add the following environment variables:

```env
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

To generate a secure secret:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Paste the output in `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.

--- -->
### 3. Environment Configuration (Under Review)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This section is subject to changes and will be updated soon.  
> Please refer to the upcoming issue for accurate environment variable setup and dev environment handling.

‚û°Ô∏è **Temporary Step:** You can still create a `.env.local` file for local testing, but this might change later.

We will finalize the exact `.env` structure once the configuration flow is solidified.


<!-- ### 4. Create GitHub OAuth App

If you don't have GitHub OAuth credentials, follow these steps:

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
2. Under **OAuth Apps**, click **New OAuth App**.
3. Fill in the required fields:

```
Application Name: Dijkstra-Web Local
Homepage URL: http://localhost:3000
Authorization Callback URL: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
```

4. Click **Register application**.
5. Copy the **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**.

Update `.env.local` with these values:

```env
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

--- -->

### 4. GitHub OAuth Setup (On Hold)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub OAuth environment configuration is currently under review and may change.  
> Full setup steps will be provided once finalized.

In the meantime, you may explore the project using mock data or without authentication if supported.


### 5. Restart the Development Server

Stop the server (if running):

```bash
Ctrl + C
```

Then restart:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the Dijkstra Web Client.
