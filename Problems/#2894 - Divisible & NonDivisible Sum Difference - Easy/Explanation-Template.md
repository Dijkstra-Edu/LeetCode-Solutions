## üìù Introduction

*In this problem, we are given two integers (n,m).
Then, we are asked to define the two integers as follows:*

*num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m. <br> 
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.*

*Finally, we are asked to return the integer obtained after calculating (num1 - num2).*
