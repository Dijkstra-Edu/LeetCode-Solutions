# Explanation of the Code

## **Objective**
The goal of the program is to find the length of the longest "nice" subarray within the input array `nums`. A subarray is considered "nice" if the bitwise AND operation between every pair of elements in the subarray results in `0`. The program efficiently calculates this using a sliding window approach.

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **1. Initialize Variables**
```java
int maxLength = 1, left = 0, usedBits = 0;

for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    while ((usedBits & nums[right]) != 0) {
        usedBits ^= nums[left++];
    }
    usedBits |= nums[right];
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
}
Outer Loop (for): Iterates through each element of the array using the right pointer, which represents the end of the current window.

Inner Loop (while):
(usedBits & nums[right]) != 0: Checks if adding the current element (nums[right]) to the subarray would result in a bitwise AND operation that is non-zero, which violates the "nice" condition.

usedBits ^= nums[left++]: Removes the element at the left pointer from the subarray by performing a bitwise XOR, effectively shrinking the window from the left until the subarray is "nice" again.

Update Subarray:
usedBits |= nums[right]: Adds the current element (nums[right]) to the subarray by updating the usedBits variable using a bitwise OR operation.

maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1): Updates the maximum length of the "nice" subarray encountered so far.

return maxLength;
Returns the length of the longest "nice" subarray.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Each element is added and removed from the window at most once, making the overall traversal linear.

Space Complexity: O(1)
We use only a few integer variables.
