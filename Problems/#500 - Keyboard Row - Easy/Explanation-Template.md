## üõ†Ô∏è Breakdown of Approache Used

### Optimized Approach

- **Explanation:** *Here we use Python's Counter (a hash map / dictionary) to count frequencies in O(n + m) time. Then we check for each character in ransomNote whether there are enough occurrences in magazine.*
- **Time Complexity:** *O(n+m) - Linear time based on the input sizes.*
- **Space Complexity:** *O(1) - Constant space if the alphabet is limited (lowercase letters).*
- **Example/Dry Run:**
