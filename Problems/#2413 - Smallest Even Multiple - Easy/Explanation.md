# Explanation of the `smallestEvenMultiple` Code

This Java class provides a solution to calculate the smallest even multiple of a given number `n`.

## Class: `Solution`

### Method: `smallestEvenMultiple(int n)`

#### **Purpose**
The method returns the smallest even multiple of the integer `n`.

#### **Parameters**
- `n`: A positive integer.

#### **Logic**
1. **Check if `n` is Even**:
   - If `n % 2 == 0` (i.e., `n` is divisible by 2 without a remainder), then `n` is already an even number. In this case, return `n`.

2. **Calculate the Smallest Even Multiple**:
   - If `n` is odd, its smallest even multiple is `n * 2`, because multiplying any odd number by 2 produces the smallest even multiple of that number.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Depending on the condition, either `n` or `n * 2` is returned.
