# Explanation of the Program

## **Objective**
The program determines whether it is possible to divide an array of integers into pairs such that each pair consists of identical elements. If this is possible, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **1. Input and HashMap Initialization**
- The input is an array `nums` of integers.
- A `HashMap` is used to count the frequency of each integer in the array.
  - **Key:** The integer from the array.
  - **Value:** The number of times the integer appears in the array.

### **2. Counting Frequencies**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    map.put(nums[i], map.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);
}

Time Complexity
Building the Frequency Map:
The loop iterates through the array once, making this O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Checking Frequencies:
The loop iterates through the values in the HashMap, which is proportional to the number of distinct integers in the array. In the worst case, there can be up to n distinct integers, so this step is O(n).
Overall Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity
HashMap Storage:
The HashMap stores the frequencies of at most n distinct integers. In the worst case, the space required is O(n).
Overall Space Complexity: O(n)
