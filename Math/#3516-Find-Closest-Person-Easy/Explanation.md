## üìù Introduction

We are given three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` representing positions of three people on a number line:
- Person 1 is at position `x`.
- Person 2 is at position `y`.
- Person 3 is at position `z` (stationary).

Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.  
We must determine which person reaches Person 3 first:
- Return `1` if Person 1 arrives first.
- Return `2` if Person 2 arrives first.
- Return `0` if both arrive at the same time.

## üí° Approach & Key Insights

The problem reduces to comparing **absolute distances** from each person to Person 3:
- `dist1 = abs(x - z)`
- `dist2 = abs(y - z)`

The smaller distance determines who reaches first. If both distances are equal, both reach at the same time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Breakdown of Approaches

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Direct Distance Comparison

- **Explanation:**  
  Compute the absolute difference in positions between each moving person and Person 3. Compare distances to decide the result.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) ‚Äî Only two distance calculations and a comparison.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) ‚Äî Only a few variables are used.

Example:  
```
x = 2, y = 7, z = 4
dist1 = |2 - 4| = 2
dist2 = |7 - 4| = 3
Output: 1 (Person 1 arrives first)
```
