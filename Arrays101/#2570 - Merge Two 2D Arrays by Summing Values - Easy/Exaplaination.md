The given Solution class contains a method mergeArrays that takes two 2D integer arrays, nums1 and nums2. The goal of this method is to merge these two arrays based on their IDs, summing up the values for each ID, and return the merged result.

Explanation of the Code:
Class Definition and Method Declaration:

The class Solution contains the method mergeArrays which takes two 2D arrays of integers as input.

Constants and Data Structures:

final int kMax = 1000; – This defines the maximum possible ID value, assumed to be 1000.

List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>(); – This initializes an empty list to store the merged result.

int[] count = new int[kMax + 1]; – This initializes an array to keep track of the counts for each ID.

Helper Method addCount:

addCount(nums1, count); and addCount(nums2, count); – These lines call the helper method addCount to update the count array with values from nums1 and nums2.

The helper method addCount iterates through each ID-value pair in the input array nums, and updates the count array by adding the values to their corresponding indices.

Building the Result:

The loop for (int i = 1; i <= kMax; ++i) iterates through the count array.

If the count for a particular ID i is greater than 0, it adds an array {i, count[i]} to the result list ans.

Returning the Result:

return ans.stream().toArray(int[][]::new); – This converts the list ans to a 2D array and returns it.
