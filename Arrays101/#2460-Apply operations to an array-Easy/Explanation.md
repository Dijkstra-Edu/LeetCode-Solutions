Explanation:

->So this problem has two components. One is to double nums[i] and make nums[i+1] as 0 IF nums[i] is equal to nums[i+1]. Second is to move all the zeros to the end. The first part is a basic loop running from 0 upto length-2 since we have an operation which requires checking the next element as we iterate through the array. Now for the second part we use a two-pointer approach(not a literal pointer in case you are doing this in C/C++). Take two variables k and j pointing to the first element of the array(i.e k=0,j=0). Now loop the array from 0  upto lenth-1. Now when array[k] is not equal to 0, swap j value and k value and increment j. Outside the if condition increment k(in case of a while loop). Let's take an example. array = [1,0,0,2,0,3,4]. First k=0 and j=0 point to 1. array[k] was not 0 so we swap array[j] and array[k] and now j=1 and k=1 point to the next element 0(both are incremented). Now array[k] is 0 so it doesnt increment j=1. Now k=2 points to the next 0. Again j doesn't  increment and k=3 now. Since k is non zero we swap k=3 and j=1. Now we have the array = [1,2,0,0,0,3,4] and j=2 and k=4 now. array[k] is zero so again j=2 not incremented and k=5. Now array[k] is non zero so we swap k=5 and j=2 which gives us [1,2,3,0,0,0,4].
Now j=3 and k=6 since k was non zero. Now again k is non zero so we swap k and j and the loops ends giving us array=[1,2,3,4,0,0,0] hence shifting all the zeros successfully.
