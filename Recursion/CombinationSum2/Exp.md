Before starting the recursion, sort the array to ensure combinations are in order and duplicates can be easily skipped. The recursive function begins at index 0, and at each step, you check whether the current element can be added to the combination. If yes, add it to the data structure, reduce the target by that elementâ€™s value, and move to the next index while skipping over consecutive duplicate elements to avoid forming repeated sequences. If the current element exceeds the target, terminate that recursive path since the array is sorted and no further elements can satisfy the target. Whenever the target reaches zero, add the current combination to the final answer. After each recursive call, backtrack by removing the last added element to correctly explore other possible combinations.
