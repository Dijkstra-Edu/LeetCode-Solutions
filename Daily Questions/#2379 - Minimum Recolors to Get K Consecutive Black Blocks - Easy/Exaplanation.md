n: The length of the input string blocks.

b: A counter to keep track of the number of black blocks within a sliding window.

Max: To store the maximum number of black blocks found in any sliding window of length k.

This loop counts the number of black blocks ('B') in the first window of length k and assigns it to both b and Max.

This loop slides the window across the string from index 0 to n - k - 1.

It decreases the count b if the block at the start of the window is 'B'.

It increases the count b if the block at the end of the window is 'B'.

Updates Max to the maximum value between the current Max and b.

If Max becomes equal to or greater than k, it means we already have k consecutive black blocks, and hence, no recoloring is needed. The function returns 0.

If the loop completes without finding k consecutive black blocks, the function returns the difference between k and Max, which represents the minimum number of recolors needed.
