# Explanation of the `repairCars` Code

This Java class provides an efficient solution for calculating the minimum time required to repair a given number of cars, given the repair capabilities of different mechanics. The code uses a **binary search algorithm** to minimize the time.

## Class: `Solution`

The `Solution` class consists of two primary methods:
- `repairCars(int[] ranks, int cars)`
- `numCarsFixed(int[] ranks, long minutes)`

### 1. Method: `repairCars`

#### **Purpose**
This method calculates the minimum time required to repair all the cars.

#### **Parameters**
- `ranks`: An array of integers, where each element represents the "rank" of a mechanic. A lower rank indicates a faster mechanic.
- `cars`: An integer indicating the number of cars that need to be repaired.

#### **Logic**
1. **Initialization**:
   - `l` is initialized to `0` (minimum possible time).
   - `r` is initialized to the maximum possible time:
     

\[
     r = \text{(minimum rank)} \times \text{cars}^2
     \]


   - This is because the worst-case scenario occurs when the fastest mechanic fixes all cars, and time increases quadratically with the number of cars.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - While `l` is less than `r`, calculate the middle point `m = (l + r) / 2`.
   - Check if it is possible to repair the required number of cars within `m` minutes by calling `numCarsFixed(ranks, m)`:
     - If **true**, reduce the upper bound `r` to `m` (try to minimize time
