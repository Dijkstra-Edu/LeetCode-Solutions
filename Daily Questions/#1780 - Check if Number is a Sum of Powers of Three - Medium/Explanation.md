Loop Initiation:

The while loop runs as long as n is greater than 0.

Inside the loop, the method checks the remainder of n when divided by 3 using the modulus operator (%).

Checking the Remainder:

If the remainder is 2 ((n % 3) == 2), the method immediately returns false.

This is because the remainder 2 indicates that n cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three, as powers of three must have remainders of 0 or 1 when divided by 3.

Updating n:

If the remainder is not 2, the method updates the value of n by dividing it by 3 (n /= 3).

Completion:

If the loop completes without finding a remainder of 2, the method returns true.

This means that the initial value of n can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three.
