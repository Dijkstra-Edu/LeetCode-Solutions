The sum variable is initialized to 1. This represents the initial colored cell at step 1.

A for loop iterates from i = 2 to i = n. In each iteration:

(i - 1) * 4 is calculated and added to sum.

This represents the number of new colored cells added at each step.

The method returns the final value of sum, which is the total number of colored cells after n steps.
