## Explanation of the `numberOfAlternatingGroups` Method

The `numberOfAlternatingGroups` method in the `Solution` class takes an array of integers `colors` and an integer `k` as input, and returns the number of alternating groups of size `k` within the array.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Initialization**
    ```java
    int window = 1;
    int res = 0;
    int n = colors.length;
    int i = 0;
    int j = 1;
    ```
    - `window`: Keeps track of the current window size.
    - `res`: Stores the count of alternating groups of size `k`.
    - `n`: Stores the length of the `colors` array.
    - `i`, `j`: Pointers to traverse the array.

2. **While Loop to Traverse the Array**
    ```java
    while(i < colors.length) {
        if(colors[(j-1) % n] != colors[j%n]) {
            window++;
            j++;
        }else {
            i = j;
            j = i + 1;
            window = 1;
            continue;
        }

        if(window == k) {
            res++;
            if(colors[(j-1) % n] != colors[j%n]) {
                i++;
                window -= 1;
            }else {
                i = j;
                j = i + 1;
                window = 1;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - The loop iterates through the array while `i` is less than the length of `colors`.
    - It checks if the current and the next colors are different. If they are different, the window size is incremented, and `j` is incremented.
    - If they are the same, it resets the window and continues the iteration.
    - When the window size reaches `k`, it increments the `res` count and adjusts the window accordingly.

3. **Return the Result**
    ```java
    return res;
    ```
    - Returns the total count of alternating groups of size `k`.

### Example

Given the `colors` array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` and `k = 3`:
- The method will return `2` since there are two alternating groups of size 3: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 1, 2]`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this method is O(n), where `n` is the length of the `colors` array, as it traverses the array a constant number of times.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n) as only a few variables are used, and no additional data structures are required.
